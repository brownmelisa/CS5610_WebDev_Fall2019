4. How many HTML / CSS tutorial exercises did you do?
   I did the first chunk of lessons (~30 each) for HTML and CSS and
   their accompanying exercises. I plan on goign back for the more
   advanced topics a little each week.

5. How comfortable do you feel with HTML and CSS now?
   I feel pretty comfortable with the basic syntax and structure,
   but will need to refer back to the tutorial for more advanced
   topics.

6. How many JS tutorial exercises did you do?
   I completed all of first chunk labeled "JS Tutorial" then did
   JS Functions and the JS HTML DOM sections since they seemed
   the most needed for this homework. 

7. How comfortable do you feel with JS now?
   I'm still slightly confused about how it all fits together with
   HTML and CSS. I'm ok with the actual syntax of the language since
   it's not all that different from Java, Python, Perl, etc.

   (https://validator.w3.org/)
   Yes, check all sites with no errors or warnings.

9. Which parts of this assignment did you have trouble with, if any?
   Getting the logic correct with the calculator. I wasn't sure if I
   programmed the buttons properly because I wasn't sure exaclty
   how a 4-function calculator was supposed to work.
